    <h1 class = "Title"> What is Dungeons and Dragons? </h1>
    <p> Departing ways from your compainion, you make way to your tent. As you lay down and the sweet whispers of sleep start wraping around your body, you hear the gnar of wolves outside. The foam from their hungry mouthes and their feet unrest the leaves as they make their way towards you. <u> what do you do!?? </u>
    </p>
    <p> This is how DnD was introduced to me by my father many years ago, and I have loved it ever since. DnD is storytelling. It is having fun with your friends and going on an adventure. It is a tabletop roleplaying game created by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson back in 1974, and it has provided countless hours of entertainment and joy. The outcome of the game is decided by dice. The players decide what they want to do, roll a 20 sided die, and based on its outcome the Dungeon Master (DM) will decide what happens. That is essentially DnD. Of course there are a lot more rules, but when it gets down to it, that will always be the essence.
    <h2> What is this Website for? </h2>
    <p> I have created this website for anyone trying to get into DnD and wants to see how it works. Well to play DnD they first need to make their character, and I have decided to ease them into that process here. I have left the numbers and technical jargon out, but have linked the full players handbook, if they wish to use it. </p>
    <h2> How to use this Website? </h2>
