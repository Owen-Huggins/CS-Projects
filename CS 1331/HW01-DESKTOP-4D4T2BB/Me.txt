	Hey! My name is Owen Huggins, and I am a CS Major at Georgia Tech. This is my second semester here and I have been having a really great time so 
far. I am currently a pledge at the Theta Chi Fraternity, and I like to play DnD, Chess, and video games with my friends. I am excited to explore Atlanta more
this semester and see all that this city has to offer. I am in the 01R section of the Recitation.
